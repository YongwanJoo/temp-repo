This is lab 2-1.
Lap 2-1 is summary for class contents.
Today i learned about how to make branch and file.
First click main branch, type new branch's name and click create new branch.
Second click add file and click create file.
Type your code on new created file and click Commit changes.
Third if you want to request your branch's file, click Pull requests and request to main branch's user to
commit your request.
If your request successfully merged on main branch you can check your file on main branch.
Finally if you want to make your own repository, click + symbol that next to your profile icon.
Thank you!
